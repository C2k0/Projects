# ChrisWiki (ARCHIVED)

**Status:** Archived - Project was shelved

## Original Goal
Building a TiddlyWiki clone to manage notes for classes and other topics.

## Contents
- `empty.html` - TiddlyWiki export (2.2MB)
- `Notes_files/` - Empty markdown scaffolding files
- `Project notes.txt` - Implementation notes about deployment options

## Reason for Archiving
Project appears to have stalled at planning/exploration phase. Only scaffolding and a TiddlyWiki export remain.
