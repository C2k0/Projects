# Housing Projects

Analysis of housing price data vs. various factors including climate, time of year, and economic indicators.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with analysis code
- `data/` - Zillow housing data (ZHVI, rental prices) and weather data

## Notes

**Path References:** Notebooks use `PATH = str(Path(os.getcwd()).parent)` to reference data files. Data paths have been updated from `/Data/` to `/data/` to match the new lowercase folder structure.

## Current Projects

- **Zillow Index (ZHVI) vs. Weather** - Analyzing correlation between housing values and weather patterns (incomplete)
